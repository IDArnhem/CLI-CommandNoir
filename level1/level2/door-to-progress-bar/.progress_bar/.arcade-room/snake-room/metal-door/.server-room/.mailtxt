Dear Kitty,

I quit my job at the cheese shop today and I've decided
to go on a holiday to the mountains.

I've met Oliver and Paul at the Progress Bar and
they told me that they will take turns to come and spend 
some time with you and feed you. Be nice to them please.

I'll be back next week. Remember to water the plants.

Big loves,
Sara.
