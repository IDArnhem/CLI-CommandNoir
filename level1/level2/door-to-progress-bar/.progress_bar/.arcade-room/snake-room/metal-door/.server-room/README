Maybe you can nmap the network to see who is around. Use:

$ nmap -sP <your subnet>

Find who is who:

 ___   _      ___   _      ___   _      ___   _      ___   _
[(_)] |=|    [(_)] |=|    [(_)] |=|    [(_)] |=|    [(_)] |=|
 '-`  |_|     '-`  |_|     '-`  |_|     '-`  |_|     '-`  |_|
/mmm/  /     /mmm/  /     /mmm/  /     /mmm/  /     /mmm/  /
      |____________|____________|____________|____________|
                         |            |            |
                     ___  \_      ___  \_      ___  \_
                    [(_)] |=|    [(_)] |=|    [(_)] |=|
                     '-`  |_|     '-`  |_|     '-`  |_|
                    /mmm/        /mmm/        /mmm/
