.-------------=====--------------.
   Apple's default installation
   of python is crippled.

   You can't go very far with
   such puny tools.

   If you want to pick the locks
   along the way, you will need
   to supercharge your python.

   To install the stuff you need
   to become `super user` (su).
   That's the user in your
   computer that dares to do
   risky stuff. But Apple will
   not let you, you can only
   pose as `super user` in OSX.

   You do that by preceding any
   risky command with the command
   `sudo` (do as `super user`).

   Install the python package
   installer `pip`:

   $ sudo easy_install pip

   Use your new flashy `pip` to
   install other python libraries
   that you will need:

   $ sudo pip install requests
   $ sudo pip install twilio
   $ sudo pip install pillow
   $ sudo pip install sqlite
   $ sudo pip install docopt
   $ sudo pip install lxml
   $ sudo pip install nltk
   $ sudo pip install SimpleAES
