 /\_/\       we are going to need heftier tools for
( o.o )  - the challenges ahead... but with `homebrew` we

Homebrew is a package manager.
It let's you install useful software
to hack on stuff that Apple thinks is
too irresponsible to let you use.

You can install any package by typing:

$ brew install <package-name>

Let's try and install two interesting packages:

$ brew install nmap
$ brew install wget

[nextt>> install `nmap` and `wget` and then take one of the doors]
