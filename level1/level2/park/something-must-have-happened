I've heard all kinds of
stories about the Progress Bar
you gotta be 1337 to get in.

You better brush up on our command line fu
otherwise this is the end of our quest.

Remember:

$ file some-file-name

Gives you a hint about the contents of a
any file you give it.

To make a script executable, you use the
command `chmod`, and you can give yourself
the right of execution by giving it `u+x`
rights, like this:

$ chmod u+x some-script-file-name



[forward>> go to the `progress bar`]      [back>> stay playing fetch with hound]
