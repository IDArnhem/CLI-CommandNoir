To move up and down these directories we
are going to use the `cd` command. `cd` is
short for "change directory", you follow
the command by the name of the directory
you want to go to.

$ cd level1

To go back one level up, there's a special
directory called `..` that will get you there
by typing.

$ cd ..

You can use the `ls` command
to list what is in the current
directory any time you like.

Now is a good time.

[next>> change to `level1`]
