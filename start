Well done on using the `cat` command.
You're on your way to becoming a CLI ninja!

The command `cat` let's you view the contents
of a file. Make friends with the `cat`, it will help
you in this adventure. You can tell the `cat` which
file you want to read and the `cat` will show it to you.

The play field of this game consists of a
tree of directories, each containing a few
characters with their own story.

All commands in the terminal can be followed by
parameters, each has a bag of trick accessible with
parameters. For example, `cat` takes as its first parameter
the name of the file you want to view. Try:

$ cat moving-around

[next>> go to `moving-around`]
